                    COVID-19 most often causes respiratory symptoms that can feel much like a cold, the flu, or pneumonia. COVID-19 may attack more than your lungs and respiratory system. Other parts of your body may also be affected by the disease. Most people with COVID-19 have mild symptoms, but some people become severely ill.
                    
                    Some people including those with minor or no symptoms will develop Post-COVID Conditions – also called “Long COVID.”<COVID-19></COVID-19></a></li>
                  <li><a class="dropdown-item" href="#">How does COVID-19 spread?
                    COVID-19 spreads when an infected person breathes out droplets and very small particles that contain the virus. Other people can breathe in these droplets and particles, or these droplets and particles can land on their eyes, nose, or mouth. In some circumstances, these droplets may contaminate surfaces they touch.
                    
                    Anyone infected with COVID-19 can spread it, even if they do NOT have symptoms.
                    
                    The risk of animals spreading the virus that causes COVID-19 to people is low. The virus can spread from people to animals during close contact. People with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 should avoid contact with animals</a></li>
